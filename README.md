# BE@R-e Controller
Python is a genus of constricting snakes in the Pythonidae family native to the tropics and subtropics of the Eastern Hemisphere. The name python was proposed by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes. Currently, 10 python species are recognized as valid taxa. Pythons are especially prevalent in places such as Florida, as well as anywhere both tropical and subtropical. Burmese Pythons in particular are actually invasive to Florida, as they out compete or eat up most typical wildlife.

Below are the instructions for Python, ROBOrio and deployment, and the to do list for the team.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Instructions
The Github repository is structured where "Main.py" is the main handler, the LabVIEW equivalent of "Robot Main.vi". In "commands" there are files like "teleop.py" for TeleOperated mode and "auto.py" for autonomous mode. The "constants" folder is for constant values held and shared. Changing may break code or something. Folder "subsytems" contain the drivetrain and utilities such as a ball intake. Please organize accordingly, as my expierence with being a game developer- FILE ORGANIZATION HELPS MAN so yeah you do you just don't break shit.

If RobotPy is not working on your computer or on this web, please open (the) Terminal and type the following:

- pip install robotpy
- pip install wpilib
- pip install robotpy-rev
- pip install robotpy-ctre
- pip install robotpy-navx
- pip install robotpy-pathplanner
- pip install rev

If still not working, you may need to import the WPI Library. Be sure to include this in your code:

- import wpilib
- import wpilib.drive (not always, but necessary)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy to ROBOrio, open the Terminal do the following:

Install RobotPy and REV on the ROBOrio
- py -3 -m robotpy_installer download robotpy
- py -3 -m robotpy_installer install robotpy
- py -3 -m robotpy_installer install robotpy-rev
- py -3 -m robotpy_installer install [any other libraries required]

Define the path to the module. This is typically a folder. Make sure "robot.py" and "pyproject.toml" exist inside the folder that is your robot module. Format; C:\Path1\Path2\Path3\Folder
- cd C:\path1\path2\path3\Folder

Deploy the code
- py -3 -m robotpy deploy

Additionally, you can simulate the robot:
- py -3 -m robotpy sim

As well as add Telemetry data for debugging and output reading
- wpilib.SmartDashboard.putNumber("Joystick Y", y_speed)

When simulating/executing the module code onto your computer, it should run once unless pushing out the outputs at least once and finish. You should recieve any errors along with where they occur. When deployed to a ROBORio, the wpilib Framework should handle it, which means that we can omit some parts of what you'd think should be in there, such as output update loops. Or least that's what I've learned, find out for yourself or something.

Drive logic can be handled by the FRC Driver Station, which means you can use that to switch between modes, i.e., Autonomous and TeleOperated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended to do this on your client (computer) and run on an environment such as VS Code. Open codespaces on VS or Github to work together in real-time.

# To Do List

Create a basic drivetrain.
- Begin
- Autonomous Drive (refine this)
- TeleOperation Drive

Utilities
- Sensors/Camera if needed (mechanical team aint doing shi)
- Objective Mechanism control (like a ball groper)
- Driver Station Utilities (xbox controller lol)

Refer to Dhillan for more instructions if not here.

Refer to RobotPy Documentation if you don't know jackshit atm.

Remember to ask Sanjoe if there are snacks at the competition.
