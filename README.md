# BE@R-e Controller
Python is a genus of constricting snakes in the Pythonidae family native to the tropics and subtropics of the Eastern Hemisphere. The name python was proposed by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes. Currently, 10 python species are recognized as valid taxa. Pythons are especially prevalent in places such as Florida, as well as anywhere both tropical and subtropical. Burmese Pythons in particular are actually invasive to Florida, as they out compete or eat up most typical wildlife.

Below are the instructions for Python, ROBOrio and deployment, and the to do list for the team.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Instructions
The Github repository is structured where "Main.py" is the main handler, the LabVIEW equivalent of "Robot Main.vi". In "commands" there are files like "teleop.py" for TeleOperated mode and "auto.py" for autonomous mode. The "constants" folder is for constant values held and shared. Changing may break code or something. Please organize accordingly, as my expierence with being a game developer- FILE ORGANIZATION HELPS MAN so yeah you do you just don't break shit.

If RobotPy is not working on your computer or on this web, please open (the) Terminal and type the following:

- pip install robotpy
- pip install wpilib
- pip install robotpy-rev
- pip install robotpy-ctre
- pip install robotpy-navx
- pip install robotpy-pathplanner

If still not working, you may need to import the WPI Library. Be sure to include this in your code:

- import wpilib

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy to ROBOrio, do the following:

Install RobotPy on the ROBOrio
- py -3 -m robotpy_installer download robotpy
- py -3 -m robotpy_installer install robotpy

Deploy the code
- py -3 -m robotpy deploy

Additionally, you can simulate the robot:
- py -3 -m robotpy sim

As well as add Telemetry data for debugging and output reading
- wpilib.SmartDashboard.putNumber("Joystick Y", y_speed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended to do this on your client (computer) and run on an environment such as VS Code. Open codespaces on VS or Github to work together in real-time.
